No promises, no trust, satisfaction 100% guaranteed! I delivery usable production code every 72 hours. You will be given access to a private staging server, where you can examine your website in action, on a private domain. If you like what you see [you will!], pay for it and run it on your domain. If you don't like it, I will work until it is fixed. You pay <em>after</em> you are satisfied. No contract required. Code is stored on a <a href = "/category/software/">private GIT</a>. You will be given administrator credentials. You can lock me out of the project at will.
